                        <p>
                            Caleb Leavell grew up in the Phoenix valley. 
                            After completing high school in Spring 2023
                            with 2 Associate's
                            Degrees through the Dual Enrollment Program,
                            and is completing the senior year of his
                            Bachelor's Degree (BS) in Computer Science (Expected May 2026). 
                            <br><br>
                            Caleb is also currently following the Accelerated
                            Program Track which will allow him to complete his
                            Master's Degree (MS) in Computer Science within a 
                            year after completing his undergraduate program
                            (Expected May 2027).
                            He will be completing at least 12 credits towards
                            the graduate program in his senior year.

                                    Existing TUI libraries generally target raw terminals (handle user input every time a key is pressed). 
                                    However, there are many applications that are simple enough to live in the default cooked terminal 
                                    (handle user input when the user presses enter). Examples of these applications are:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>CLI Wizards</strong> (installation, configuration, setup flows)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Menu-Driven Tools</strong> (interactive scripts, database helpers, git interfaces)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Logic Prototyping</strong> (quickly testing algorithms or workflows)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Simple REPLs</strong> (read-eval-print loops that don't need per-keystroke input)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Text Adventures &amp; Games</strong> (turn-based input works well in cooked mode)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Jatui is a Java library that provides a framework for building TUIs that are meant to run in a 
                                    cooked-terminal environment by implementing a modularized, declarative system that allows for reusable, 
                                    customizable, and analyzable application units.
