                            Caleb Leavell grew up in the Phoenix valley. 
                            After completing high school with 2 Associate's
                            Degrees through the Dual Enrollment Program,
                            he is currently attending Arizona State University
                            and is currently completing the senior year of his
                            Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (BS). <br><br>
                            Caleb is also currently following the Accelerated
                            Program Track which will allow him to complete his
                            Master's Degree in Computer Science (MS) within a 
                            year after completing his undergraduate program.
                            He will be completing at least 12 credits towards
                            the graduate program in his senior year.

                                            Developed and deployed a Java TUI library with a modular, ANSI-supported UI class system,
                                            enabling faster and more scalable command-line UI development for other developers.

                                            registered users to view their net worth over time and get the latest stock news.

                                            Built the application using the .NET framework and followed a microservice architecture that
                                            integrated third-party and custom RESTful/WSDL APIs.

                                            Built and deployed a paint program in PyGame, including features such as undo/redo, a

                                            O(1) by only rendering new changes, while full redraws (e.g., after an undo) remained O(n^2).
